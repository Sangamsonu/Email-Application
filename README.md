Title: Email Application in Java

Abstract:
The Email Application project is a Java-based application that enables users to create email accounts, generate random passwords, and manage various settings. The application prompts users to enter their first and last names, select a department, and automatically generates an email address based on the provided information. Additionally, the application allows users to customize mailbox capacity, set alternate email addresses, and change passwords.

Introduction:
Email communication is an integral part of modern business operations, necessitating efficient and user-friendly email management systems. The Email Application project aims to provide a simplified email account creation and management solution using Java programming. This paper explores the key features and implementation details of the Email Application.

Methods and Functionality:
The Email Application utilizes object-oriented programming principles to implement various functionalities. The main class, "EmailApp," acts as the entry point of the application. It prompts users to input their first and last names and initializes an instance of the "Email" class. The "Email" class encapsulates the logic for generating email addresses, setting department codes, generating random passwords, and managing account information.

Upon instantiation, the "Email" class prompts the user to select a department and generates an email address based on the provided information. It also generates a random password, which is displayed to the user. Users can customize mailbox capacity, set alternate email addresses, and change passwords using the appropriate methods provided by the "Email" class.

Results and Discussion:
The Email Application successfully creates email accounts and provides users with essential account details. The project leverages Java's built-in functionalities such as the "Scanner" class for user input and the "Random" class for generating random passwords. The application demonstrates the usage of constructors, methods, and instance variables to implement the desired functionalities.

Conclusion:
The Email Application project offers a practical and straightforward solution for creating and managing email accounts in Java. It provides users with the ability to generate custom email addresses, set mailbox capacity, manage alternate email addresses, and change passwords.
